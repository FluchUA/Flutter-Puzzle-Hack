# Flutter Puzzle Hack

A new Flutter project.

Participating in the contest created a flutter header. The game uses only standard tools, most of it is Canvas.

For details such as the style of buttons, splash screen themes I have not spent time because the style is not particularly impressive. On the game itself because of the situation in the country also did not have a lot of time because there was not enough time to implement good optimization.
