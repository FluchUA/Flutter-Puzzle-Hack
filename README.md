# Flutter Puzzle Hack

A new Flutter project.

Participating in the contest created a flutter header. The game uses only standard tools, most of it is Canvas.

For details such as the style of buttons, splash screen themes I have not spent time because the style is not particularly impressive. On the game itself because of the situation in the country also did not have a lot of time because there was not enough time to implement good optimization.




Difficulties encountered:
At the moment there is a problem with optimization (multiplication of transformation matrices) and scaling.

Also on the mobile platform, you can observe a strange effect in the form of randomly appearing green pixels. Apparently some errors on the side of the engine, did not have time to figure it out

Due to the tense situation in the country, it is not possible to continue working on the game.
No war!
